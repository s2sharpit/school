                <p>We have facility for the students to get the habit of reading in library. The habit of reading is nurtured from childhood, which moulds and enriches the growing minds, shapes their nascent values and develops the right perspectives.

                <h3>Labs</h3>
                <p>The school has well equipped laboratories for Physics, Chemistry and Biology wherein the students are encouraged to learn through experiments and understand various concepts beyond their books away from the conventional classroom teaching. Every year these labs are furnished with the latest instruments, specimens, charts etc.</p>
                <p>Science lab equipments allow students to interact directly with the data gathered. They get a first-hand learning experience by performing various experiments on their own. Students are made to use the models and understand different scientific theories and concepts, thus making teaching and learning easy both for the teachers, as well as for the students. There are several scientific theories and concepts that are difficult to explain directly from the books.</p>
                <p>Children develop interest in scientific research in science labs. When they observe various things and carry out different experiments, their reasoning skills are honed and they start thinking deeply on those theories and concepts.</p>
